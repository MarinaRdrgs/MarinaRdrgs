### Hello! <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MartinHeinz/MartinHeinz/master/wave.gif" width="30px">

#### I'm Marina, currently pursuing a Bachelor's Degree in Data Science and Artificial Intelligence

- I've got a practical and analytical mindset, along with a continuously growing problem-solving skill
- I'm also interested in Machine Learning, and Marketing & Business issues
- Some of my other favourite things are gaming, reading, and any dessert with strawberries.
- You can communicate with me in Portuguese, English and Spanish. I am (slowly) working German as well, so if you have any tips feel free to message me.
